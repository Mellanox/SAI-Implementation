Metadata for SAI
================

Metadata for SAI is a set of auto generated (based on SAI headers) data
and functions which allow SAI attributes validation and more.

Metadata is generated as ANSI C source and header.

Parser also forces headers to be well formated when adding new code.

To test your changes just type:

```sh
make
```
